**Part 2**

Data sources were taken from IPUMS-CPS, from the Basic Monthly Survey for 2015 - 2025 and primarily on the emp-stat variable. Data was extracted through dat and ddi files. Instructions from https://cps.ipums.org/cps/extract_instructions.shtml were followed to pull the data through R. Follow the R code to create categories for employment, non-employment, and unemployment. A data panel was created to calculate monthly transition rates, unemployment, and non-employment rates. This was used to create monthly line plots.
